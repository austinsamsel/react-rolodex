In June 2017, I hosted a [React/Redux workshop](https://www.meetup.com/New-York-DevMeetings/events/240549881/?eventId=240549881) for [DevMeetings](http://devmeetings.org/en/) at [AllStarCode](http://www.allstarcode.org/). 

React Rolodex, a DevMeetings Workshop Demo App
---

This is React Rolodex. It is the sample application which demonstrates the building blocks of React concepts over the course of 5 steps. This repository is broken up into 5 branches which shows React Rolodex at various levels of completion.

The last module and current master branch represents the app as a React Redux application.

use `git checkout` to see the app at each state after completing the modules.
